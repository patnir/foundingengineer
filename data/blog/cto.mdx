# Should You Hire a CTO?

One of my friends, running a hyper-growth company, just closed his seed round. He’s already got millions in revenue and a small team of very technical people, mostly PhD researchers. Now, he’s thinking about adding a CTO because they’re facing two main challenges:

1. Scaling hardware orchestration (it’s an AI company) to keep up with demand.
2. Creating a solid foundation for the product to make adding features easier.

Here’s my advice:

### 1. Don’t Call the Role CTO

The person you want to hire will still spend most of their time coding. In rapidly growing companies, architectures change dramatically. Until you have over 100 engineers, you don’t need full standardization (I saw this firsthand at Ridgeline). You need someone who can move fast, not be tied to their decisions, and implement these architectures hands-on.

Call the role “Staff/Principal Engineer” and add a significant equity component so they almost operate like a technical founder. This role should be a direct path to CTO if they choose.

### 2. Hire for Low Ego

A CTO title adds unnecessary ego to your startup. You need someone who prioritizes speed over perfection. Simple architectures are better for rapid growth.

Hiring someone with low ego is crucial because:

- **Decision Making**: The decisions they make should prioritize rapid progress over perfect solutions. Startups thrive on quick iterations and learning from mistakes rather than spending weeks to make the perfect choice.
- **Team Dynamics**: Low ego individuals tend to foster a collaborative environment. They are more likely to listen to other team members, welcome feedback, and make adjustments based on collective insights. This is essential in a small, fast-moving team where every member’s contribution is vital.

### 3. Ask About Their Current Job

Most of their time should be spent coding, prototyping, and unblocking other engineers. They shouldn’t be bogged down in meetings and constant decision-making. They should quickly address customer issues without needing prompts and focus on the top technical challenges.

### 4. Ask About Their Team Vision

You’ll project this person’s characteristics onto the next hires. The CEO decides, but should trust this person’s hiring decisions. Do you want five more engineers like them? They’ll likely hire friends or past colleagues, which can be beneficial.

### 5. Passion for Building

This is crucial. They should find building fun. Do they work on side projects, have startup ideas, or stories of fixing company problems for fun?

### 6. Technology Decisions

Think about onboarding the next 5-10 developers. What technologies do you use? How much expertise is available in the current talent pool? Onboarding should be quick. Prioritize developer productivity with the current tech stack. Avoid overly specialized or limiting technologies unless used for prototyping.

### 7. Red Flags 🚩

1. When you describe a complicated problem, and they immediately offer a solution without seeking to understand.
2. They propose using something like [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/), unless it’s specifically for prototyping.
3. They offer to build their own ORM or graph database to solve a problem.
4. They don't ask about the customer and use the product to understand their pain points.

### Final Thoughts

Be prepared to fire early. The best companies make decisive hiring and firing decisions. If someone isn’t a culture fit, isn’t pulling their weight, or seems absent, consider letting them go. It’s not a reflection on the person—they might be incredible but not the right fit at this time. Startups are hard for many reasons. Be very choosy, but if the right person comes along, close immediately.
