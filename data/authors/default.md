# Welcome to Founding Engineer

Hello! If you're new here, let me share a bit about myself:

## ðŸš€ My Journey

- **Startup Productivity:** I am passionate about helping startup engineers and engineering teams increase their productivity. This led me to start my blog, [foundingengineer.com](http://foundingengineer.com), where I delve into these topics extensively.

- **Early Career at Ridgeline:** Post-graduation, I joined [Ridgeline](https://ridgelineapps.com) as an early employee. It has grown into a leading wealth management platform. My time here was a deep dive into learning about new domains and building remarkable products.

- **Engineering at Atomic:** I worked as an Engineer in Residence at [Atomic](https://atomic.vc), where I helped kick-start several new ideas from scratch, evolving into companies like [joinfire.xyz](http://joinfire.xyz). This experience taught me about the early stages of J-curve growth in a company and the tough decisions that sometimes involve killing your most beloved ideas.

- **Current Role at Ironfish:** I currently work at Ironfish, privacy crypto Layer 1 backed by a16z and Sequoia. It is here that I have really learned what world class engineering looks like.

## ðŸŒ² Life Outside Work

- **Hobbies:** I spend my free time playing chess, pickleball, and tennis.

- **Outdoor Adventures:** My wife and I live in Seattle, a fantastic place for outdoor enthusiasts like us.

- **Mentoring:** I'm passionate about helping college students jumpstart their careers through programs like [Twenty](https://www.twenty.team/). Many of my mentees have received offers from top companies like Databricks, Stripe, and Amazon.

- **Personal Finance:** I am also a personal finance nerd, always on the lookout for ways to optimize my income.
